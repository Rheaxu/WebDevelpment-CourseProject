<h3>First Blog Post</h3>

<p>This is the first post on my blog. It is about some of my opinion on
    my first look at web development
</p>

<p>
    Web development is not a very difficult job. It is easy to get started and
    use. But since it's very powerful, which means it provides countless
    functions, it takes some time to play with it very well.

    CSS is a good stuff.

    I tried a little bit on Django before, since I haven't used either Django
    or .NET very much, I cannot tell which is better. And there is another
    thing called Ruby on Rail. Django and Ruby on Rail are now more prevalent.
