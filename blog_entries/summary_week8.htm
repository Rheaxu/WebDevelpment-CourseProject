<p>Experiments

<p>
    This week, I just focused on one experiment -- creating sheet music<br />
    Because this is a very important part of my project.
    I searched online and found a lot of good API. The Vexflow API seems to be the best one.
    So I downloaded it and spent a lot of time playing around with it.

    I also tried an HTML Guitar Player demo which is create by others. I've attached it's link
    in my experiment. This materials are good guide and good inspiration for my project.
