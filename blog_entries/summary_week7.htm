<h3>Summary of Week 7</h3>

<p>Experiments
</p>

<p>This week I did the following things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Jquery Hello world: I used JQuery to dynamically generate "Hello World".
    </li>
    <li>Jquery Templates: Use Jquery to clear, recover a template. And append a new template to the old one.
    </li>
    <li>Jquery draggable: Use Jquery to do draggable, including a normal draggable and one that will revert
        to the original place.
    </li>
    <li>Web Audio API: Use the HTML Web Audio tag and Web Audio API to simulate musical keyboard</li>
    
</ol>
<p>Progress on my project:
    My project will be a website about DIY. I'm now working on the sheet music DIY part.
    I use JFugue Java Library to do this. After finishing this app, I will generate JAR
    file and integrate it with my website.
