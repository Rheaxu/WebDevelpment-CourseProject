        Its more beautiful now.
    </li>
    <li>Story: Built up my story of experiments</li>
    <li>HTML: Try different html tags and combine them with CSS</li>
    <li>Box Model: Understand box model. Change attributes to get different box</li>
    <li>Angularjs: Download angularjs, import and then try some simple script on it.</li>
</ol>

    Angular is really useful. And Javascript is really amazing. For next week, I plan to dig into
    Javascript and Angular, and use them to do Data model and other more complicated experiments.
