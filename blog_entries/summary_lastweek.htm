<h3>Summary of Last Week</h3>

<p>This week, I finished my Final project: Online Sheet Music Collection and Photo
    Gallery.</p>
<p>By doing this project, I really learned a lot. I am getting more and more familiar
     with C# ASP.NET. I also learned a lot about javascript.</p>
<p>I think the most exciting part is that my website is something I am intersted in: Sheet Music. 
    I found a lot of cool APIs while searching for resources for my website.</p>
<p>Web Development is a really cool course!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Professor Jose Annunziato and My TA Sandeep Ramamoorthy.</p>
