        <h2>About this experiment</h2>
        <p>
            A media query consists of a media type and at least one expression that limits the style sheets' 
            scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color. Media queries, added in CSS3, 
            let the presentation of content be tailored to a specific range of output devices without having 
            to change the content itself.

            Preparing for court and appearing before a judge can be a daunting expe­ri­ence, par­tic­u­larly for 
            people who are rep­re­senting them­selves because they can’t afford a lawyer or simply don’t know 
            all the ropes of the legal process. <br />
            That’s why an inter­dis­ci­pli­nary team of North­eastern fac­ulty, 
            staff, and stu­dents from the School of Law, the Col­lege of Arts, Media and Design, and the Col­lege 
            of Com­puter and Infor­ma­tion Sci­ence is devel­oping an online sim­u­la­tion that would pro­vide 
            self-​​represented lit­i­gants with advo­cacy expe­ri­ence before they appear in court for real.<br />
            The sim­u­la­tion game is par­tic­u­larly tar­geted to the growing number of people who cannot afford 
            legal rep­re­sen­ta­tion and thus rep­re­sent them­selves in legal pro­ceed­ings ranging from evic­tions 
            and mort­gage fore­clo­sures to child cus­tody pro­ceed­ings and debt col­lec­tion cases. Nation­ally, more 
            than 80 per­cent of people with legal prob­lems must resolve them without the assis­tance of a lawyer.  
            When a dis­pute lands in court, people without any legal training find them­selves addressing a judge, 
            ques­tioning wit­nesses, and offering doc­u­ments into evidence.<br />
            The sim­u­la­tion game would let indi­vid­uals try out these kinds of expe­ri­ences in a vir­tual world 
            before they appear in an actual court­room. It would ulti­mately be made avail­able online for free.<br />
            “This is the begin­ning of some­thing that could be trans­for­ma­tional in the legal system,” said Dan 
            Jackson, exec­u­tive director of the NuLawLab. Jackson and NuLawLab fac­ulty director Martha Davis are 
            leading the project for North­eastern in tandem with pro­fes­sors Casper Harteveld and Gillian Smith, 
            who work in Northeastern’s Playable Inno­v­a­tive Tech­nolo­gies Lab. Law stu­dents enrolled this winter in 
            a newly cre­ated lab sem­inar on applied design and legal empow­er­ment will also be involved in the 
            project, which offi­cially begins Jan. 1.<br />
            The project was one of 17 world­wide nom­i­nated by the Hague Insti­tute for the Inter­na­tion­al­iza­tion 
            of Law for its Inno­vating Jus­tice Award – Inno­v­a­tive Idea 2014. Ear­lier this month, the North­eastern 
            “vir­tual court­room” project received the most votes (988) of the nom­i­nees and will now have a shot 
            at being named a finalist for the award in November at the institute’s Inno­vating Jus­tice Forum in 
            the Netherlands.<br />
            The North­eastern team will work with project lead Statewide Legal Ser­vices of Con­necticut and New 
            Haven Legal Assis­tance. The project has already received funding through the Legal Ser­vices 
            Corporation’s Tech­nology Ini­tia­tive Grants program.
