<h3>Summary of Week 5</h3>

<p>Experiments
</p>

<p>This week I did the following things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Redesign My home page: I use media query to make my home page completely responsive.
    </li>
    <li>Media query: read the tutorial from Mozilla, and tried to play with it a little bit. Now the page is
        reponsize. However, when the size of browser changes, the background color, text color don't change
        as expected. I will take a deep look at it next week.
    </li>
    <li>Image Gallery: This is an experiments related to my project. I created an image gallery. When you hover
        any image on in this gallery, it will rotate 360 degree and zoom in. And in this experiment, I learned
        the differences between span and div. I found that span is more convinient to use. Because I wanted to 
        separate the "Source" and "Reference" an the gallery into two lines, if I use div, it is really hard to
        do. But with span. It's very easy.
    </li>
    <li>idreambooks api: This experiment is related to my project. It uses the free api provided by idreambooks. 
        When users enter a genre, the website will return some recommended book. This experiment works. But its
        display is really ugly now. I will refine it next week. And now, retrieving book data from website is
        really slow. I will add a progress bar on the webpage next week while it's still processing.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    I've started to think about my project. But for now, I've got some ideas what techniques, for example,
    image gallery, api reference, I will use in my project. But I haven't decided the theme of my project.
    <br />
    Next week, I will completely decide the theme and start my project.
