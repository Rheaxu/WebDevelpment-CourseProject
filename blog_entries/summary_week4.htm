<h3>Summary of Week 4</h3>

<p>Experiments
</p>

<p>This week I did the following thins:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Redesign My home page: I removed bootstrap from my home page and wrote my own css file for 
        home page from scratch.
    </li>
    <li>Weather Client: I applied a free key on Online Weather website and used its API to do the 
        experiment, i.e, input zip and days number, get inquiry results from the website and display 
        it in a table
    </li>
    <li>Iter Array Angular: Used Angular to create array of objects and practised iterating
        the array and display the content in a table
    </li>
    <li>Book Library: The book library experiment is mainly about how to iterating array, delete and 
        update information in the table displayed on the web page.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now I'm getting more and more familiar and feeling more comfortable with html, css, javascript and angular. I hope in the
    following experiments, I can use this skills to build a good website.ss
